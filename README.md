#  Simple Physics Game
Simple game created to learn how to use SpriteKit in Swift as well as the built in 2D physics engine. The goal is to build the tallest tower without it being knocked over which very easy. Wind was added with a randomized amount of force to try knock over the tower once it reaches a certain height. To build the player can place bricks, "weld" two bricks together, pause the physics engine, and reset the workspace. The player can scroll horizontally over the workspace but not vertically.
